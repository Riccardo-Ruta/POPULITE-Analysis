# POPULITE-Analysis
Github folder for the analysis of the POPULITE project

# Analysis structure 

## 1_preliminar_analysis.Rmd

Includes
the cleaning of the dataset and general descriptive analysis.
The following outputs are generated from the cleaning phase (saved in the "data" folder)

- dataset.Rda --> dataset type object containing the following variables: nome, tweet_testo, genere, party_id,chamber,status, date, week, month, quarter, year)

- corpus.Rda --> corpus type object containing the following variables:: nome, tweet_testo, genere, party_id,chamber,status, date, week, month, quarter, year)

- dfm.Rda --> object type dfm generated by corpus.rda from which emoticons and stopwords (standard and additional) are removed

- in the last part of the script the variable 'party leader' is generated, which contains the name of the twitter account of the party leader, this variable is NOT included in dataset.Rda, corpus.Rda and dfm.Rda

## 2_Dictionary_analysis.Rmd

Includes 
Analysis with Decadri_Boussalis_Grundl dictionary

dictionaries are imported from the file populism_dictionaries.xlsx saved in the "data" folder

the analysis is performed on the dfm.Rda object

the result of the dictionary analysis is saved in the data_dict1.Rda object contained in the "data" folder


## 3_Sentiment_analysis.Rmd
Includes sentiment analysis with LIWC2007 dictionary

analysis is performed on the dfm.Rda object

## 4_STM_Topic_analysis.Rmd

Includes
STM topic models analysis

In the first part of the script, the dicrionary analysis of 2_Dictionary_analysis.Rmd is replicated, and the populism value is reported as a variable in the dfm.Rda object
then the dfm.Rda object is transformed into the stm object, and the latter is saved in the "data" folder as: DfmStm.Rda

The first step of the STM analysis is to search for the number of k, the result of this search is saved in the "data" folder as: storageNoG.Rda

The model with k = 10 is saved in the "data" folder as: mySTM10NoG.Rda

The model with k = 18 is saved in the "data" folder as: mySTM18NoG.Rda


## 5_FER_Emotion_analysis.Rmd

Includes descriptive analyses performed on the extracted .csv files using the emotion recognition application. (https://share.streamlit.io/ruta-dsp/emotion_detection/main/FER.py)

## 00_Appendix.Rmd

This Rmd is used to call all the above-mentioned Rmarkdowns and generate a single pdf

# Folder structures

- Docs
The "docs" folder contains useful reference papers for the study

- Figs
The "figs" folder contains all the plot of the images of the analysis

- Junk
